# Recidivism Machine Learning Project
Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning Model Development of Recidivism Data

This study uses machine learning to develop a random forest model predicting success rates for individuals post-release, achieving 73% accuracy. Feature importance analysis identified program attendance as a crucial factor, emphasizing the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs in facilitating post-release employment and reducing recidivism. Positive impacts include enhanced financial stability, skill development, and social integration. Challenges such as barriers to employment and program effectiveness variations underscore the need for comprehensive support services.
Results demonstrate the model's effectiveness through feature importance validation, optimal n-estimator selection, and cross-validation. Key takeaways underscore the dependence of program efficacy on attendance, highlighting the random forest model's utility in analyzing feature importance. This research contributes valuable insights for policymakers, criminal justice practitioners, and researchers working towards reducing recidivism and improving rehabilitation outcomes. Future research aims to explore additional factors influencing rehabilitation program efficacy and complementary interventions for comprehensive support
